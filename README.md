## Project Summary

Our plan for this project is to create a robust tool that allows players to create, track, and maintain characters & campaigns in an online database. We want to put online many of the offline elements of D&D. Things like character creation, stat tracking, equipment tracking, campaign notes, campaign progress, and DM campaign variables are typically maintained with pen and paper. This tool, if fully realized, could help create an online database to track, analyze, and crowd-source aggregate player data. This data can be used to make the game as paperless as possible. It could also help users see what kind of classes, spells, and tactics are commonly used or most effective for any given campaign. In essence, this tool could help form a metagame for a game-space that typically does not engage in metagames.

## Origin Story

- We are all huge fans of the Dungeons & Dragons universe and the many, many fantasy worlds it has inspired. Building out some kind of D&D-focused application has been a goal for us ever since we started taking classes at Code Fellows. We are also tryhard gamers and wanted to incorporate some kind of shared tracking system into a gaming space that was traditionally managed with paper and pencil. We are hoping that our application can illustrate how making it easy to share, manipulate, and analyze D&D aggregate data could help create a digital online metagame for an analog gamespace.

## Things To Watch For

- We did not add strong user account authorization (yet) as it was complicating our work to get in the weeds on that feature. We wanted to get the application fully built and running first. That may come with a later update.
- We limited character creation to Level 1 characters to decrease project scope and complexity. Later updates may include the ability to update a character beyond the initial build.
