## Day 9 // 2020.06.01

**6:30pm:** Meeting to discuss changes we have individually made since Saturday. 

Madison worked on coloring some of the terminal outputs
Joel added Swagger documentation
Daniel built out the readme and will add JSDoc documentation
Clayton added more choices to the character creation process
Kory is continuing building out tests

Clayton refactored char create stuff as well as changed structure of JSON data to make it easier to work with. Will need to notify Kory in case it impacts testing.

Note for later:
We will need to update our domain model as well since our current one doesnâ€™t match our app at all.

**7:05pm:** Going to try and merge everything now. Clayton brought up some concerns about how we can test the readline functions to get our testing coverage up. We may need to ask Sonia about this. 

**7:20pm:** Joel still working on Swagger. Daniel working on JSDoc. Madison is playing with color schemes. Clayton is trying to figure out how to test Readline with mock inputs. Kory is away from home due to the protests.  

**9:00pm:** Madison finished adding flair colors. Daniel done with JSDoc. Generated HTML files but not sure how to use them. Joel done with Swagger documentation. Clayton figured out how to test Readline.

Tomorrow we will loop Kory into changes and work on the Presentation deck along. We will also look into launching our app as an NPM package.
