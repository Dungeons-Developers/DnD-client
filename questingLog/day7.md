## Day 7 // 2020.05.28

**6:30pm:** Joel refactored last night to make our nested async/awaits much cleaner. He is reviewing all changes with us now before pushing to dev.

Today we will focus on building out Char Get readline functionality. Then also incorporating Char Create such that it appends database Equipment and Spell info to the created Char object.

**7:45pm:** Got Char Get functioning correctly in the readline.

Joel identified an issue with the structure of our menu function. We may need to restructure our files in order to remove weird dependencies. 

**8:30pm:** Got in the weeds on fixing the menu issue. Pivoting back to finishing the char create additions for equipment/spells so we can knock out some more discrete tasks today. Will revisit menu issue on Saturday.
