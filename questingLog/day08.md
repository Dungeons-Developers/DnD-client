## Day 8 // 2020.05.30

**9:30am:** Clayton figured out our menu bug last night. He is walking us through the changes before pushing to dev branch.

**9:50am:** Got a list of discrete tasks to work on. Agreed that we will try to wrap up all code by Tuesday so we can focus on presentation prep.

**10:00am:** Mobbing out JSON file updates in repl for prebuilt char creation. It is kind of nice/fun to be able to all work in the same file.

**1:00pm** Going to get into weeds for full 12 class char creation. 

**1:50pm:** Refactored char creation structure. Added all 9 races and 12 classes to char creation options. Starting to build Char Delete route functionality.

Running into some critical bugs with Delete route. Turns out it was a rogue parenthetical. Fixed and route is working now. 

**2:30pm:** Team is now mob-creating delete functionality on client side. Meanwhile Kory is building tests. We ended up needing to create a completely separate menu function, `selectMenu`

**3:30pm:** Kory found and fixed an issue with mismatched character schema. Finished Char Get `menu` swap functionality to `selectMenu`.

Now working on finishing building out select and delete route on client side. Had bug. Joel found and we fixed. 

**4:00pm:** Adding confirm screen to character delete so users must enter `y/n` in order to confirm character deletion.

**4:30pm:** Reformatted character stat display within char select.

**5:00pm** Ended day early as the news of local protests was weighing heavily on our minds. Daniel assigned individual tasks for us to all work on going into Tuesday.
